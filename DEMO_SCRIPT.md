## 📋 Complete Workflow Overview - How CycleSync Works

**"Before we dive into the demo, let me explain how our platform revolutionizes the recycling supply chain:"**

### The End-to-End Process:

1. **📦 Material Submission by Supplier**
   - Supplier (e.g., plastic collection center, scrap dealer) logs into the platform
   - Fills out a detailed submission form with material type, quantity, expected quality
   - Uploads photos of the materials for AI-powered preliminary assessment
   - Selects preferred pickup/delivery options
   - Submits request for verification appointment

2. **🔍 Admin Review & Smart Assignment**
   - Admin receives instant notification via WebSocket
   - Reviews submission with AI-suggested quality score and risk assessment
   - System recommends best agent based on:
   - Admin assigns agent with one click

3. **📱 Agent Field Verification**
   - Agent receives real-time notification
   - Reviews assignment details 
   - Contacts supplier to schedule inspection visit
   - Travels to location and performs thorough inspection:
     - Verifies actual material type matches submission
     - Confirms quantity using weighing equipment
     - Assesses quality (contamination level, purity, condition)
     - Takes standardized photos from multiple angles
     - Records any discrepancies
   - Submits detailed verification report

4. **💰 Marketplace Activation**
   - Verified materials automatically listed on marketplace
   - AI-powered dynamic pricing based on:
     - Current market demand
     - Material quality score
     - Quantity available
     - Location and transport costs
   - Buyers can view all verified details
   - Options for direct purchase or auction participation

5. **🤝 Secure Transaction & Delivery**
   - Buyer places order through platform
   - Payment held in escrow for security
   - Delivery coordinated between parties
   - Upon successful delivery:
     - Payment released to supplier
     - Agent receives commission
     - Both parties rate the transaction
   - All data recorded for transparency and analytics

**"This entire process, which traditionally takes weeks with multiple middlemen, now happens in 24-48 hours with complete transparency. Let me show you exactly how it works..."**

service /material-submission on new http:Listener(8086) {
    resource function post submit(@http:Payload MaterialSubmission submission) 
        returns SubmissionResponse|error {
        // Ballerina's built-in data validation
        check submission.validate();
        
        // Async processing with Ballerina workers
        worker qualityAssessment {
            QualityScore score = check assessQuality(submission.images);
            score -> assessmentChannel;
        }
        
        // Event-driven notification
        check notifyAdminAndAgents(submission);
    }
}
```

// WebSocket notification service
service /notifications on new websocket:Listener(9102) {
    resource function get .() returns websocket:Service {
        return new NotificationService();
    }
}

// Agent assignment with location-based matching
resource function post assign-agent(@http:Payload AssignmentRequest req) 
    returns AssignmentResponse|error {
    // Spatial query using Ballerina SQL
    Agent[] nearbyAgents = check dbClient->query(
        `SELECT * FROM agents 
         WHERE ST_Distance(location, ${req.materialLocation}) < 10000
         ORDER BY rating DESC, distance ASC`
    );
    
    // Smart assignment algorithm
    Agent selectedAgent = check selectOptimalAgent(nearbyAgents, req);
    
    // Create assignment with transaction support
    transaction {
        check createAssignment(selectedAgent, req.materialId);
        check notifyAgent(selectedAgent, req);
        check commit;
    }
}
```

    resource function post graphql(@http:Payload GraphQLRequest request) 
        returns json|error {
        return check executeGraphQLQuery(request.query);
    }
    
    // Image processing with AI integration
    resource function post verify-quality(@http:Payload stream<byte[], io:Error?> image) 
        returns QualityReport|error {
        // Stream processing for large images
        byte[] imageData = check image.reduce(
            function(byte[] acc, byte[] chunk) returns byte[] {
                return [...acc, ...chunk];
            }, []
        );
        
        // AI service integration
        http:Client visionAPI = check new(VISION_API_URL);
        json qualityAnalysis = check visionAPI->post("/analyze", imageData);
        
        return transformToQualityReport(qualityAnalysis);
    }

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Material Search
```tsx
import { MaterialSearchBar } from '@/components/buyer';

const SearchPage = () => {
  const handleSearch = (query: string, filters: SearchFilters) => {
    // Implement search logic
  };

  return (
    <MaterialSearchBar
      onSearch={handleSearch}
      savedSearches={['plastic bottles', 'cardboard']}
      onSaveSearch={(query) => setSavedSearches(prev => [...prev, query])}
    />
  );
};
```

### Auction Bidding
```tsx
import { AuctionBidModal } from '@/components/buyer';

const AuctionPage = () => {
  const handlePlaceBid = (amount: number) => {
    // Implement bidding logic
  };

  return (
    <AuctionBidModal
      auction={selectedAuction}
      isOpen={showBidModal}
      onClose={() => setShowBidModal(false)}
      onPlaceBid={handlePlaceBid}
      onEnableAutoBid={handleAutoBid}
    />
  );
};
```

### Order Tracking
```tsx
import { OrderTrackingCard } from '@/components/buyer';

const OrdersPage = () => {
  return (
    <OrderTrackingCard
      order={order}
    />
  );
};
```
